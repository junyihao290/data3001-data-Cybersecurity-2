Project title: Improving Network Security by Classifying IoT Devices Based on Network Traffic Data Analysis 

Project description:  
IoT devices have become increasingly integrated into daily lives and work environments as time goes on. Duarte (2024) highlights that more than 15 billion IoT devices are connected around the world as of 2024, and predicts that the number will rise continuously. However, its security risks are becoming more and more significant with the popularity of devices, where the use of weak passwords or default passwords and open insecure service ports are considered two of the most significant vulnerabilities. At the same time, the security risks of IoT devices are exacerbated since household users do not master the necessary security knowledge (Pashamokhtari et al., 2023). To address such issues, our project focuses on network-level security by analyzing network traffic data to identify device types and detect unusual behaviour in time by establishing the network behaviour patterns of devices. 

This project builds on the research in 2021 and 2023. The research in 2021 recognized device types by analyzing nat-post IPFIX traffic data. This project also uses the idea of analyzing IPFIX data to monitor the network behavior of devices, but the project has higher device visibility and focuses on improving network security. The research in 2023 adds the concept of "concept drift", and the data for this project also involves dynamic changes.

The project dataset contains IPFIX traffic records from 25 different IoT devices in the home network collected in the NAT-pre environment from June 25, 2019, to October 10, 2019.
